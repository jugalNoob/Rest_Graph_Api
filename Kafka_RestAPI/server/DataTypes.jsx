üß± 1. Kafka Core Components (Types)
Type	Description
Producer	Sends (publishes) data/messages to Kafka topics.
Consumer	Reads (subscribes to) messages from Kafka topics.
Broker	A Kafka server that stores and serves messages. One Kafka cluster has multiple brokers.
Topic	A category or stream name to which records are sent (like a message queue).
Partition	Topics are split into partitions to allow parallel processing and scalability.
Consumer Group	A group of consumers that share the workload for a topic.
ZooKeeper (legacy)	Manages Kafka cluster metadata and leader election (being replaced by KRaft).

üß∞ 2. Kafka Data Types
Type	Description
Message	A record sent by producers, typically includes a key, value, and timestamp.
Key/Value Pair	Kafka messages are key-value pairs (like JSON, Avro, Protobuf, etc.).
Offset	Position of a record in a partition. Helps in tracking what has been read.

üîÅ 3. Kafka Deployment Types
Type	Description
Self-Hosted	You deploy and manage Kafka yourself (on-prem or cloud VMs).
Managed Kafka	Kafka as a service (e.g., Confluent Cloud, Amazon MSK, Aiven, etc.).
Kafka on Kubernetes	Kafka deployed in container orchestration platforms using Helm or operators.
Kafka in Microservices	Used as an event bus for decoupled communication in microservices.

üöÄ 4. Kafka Ecosystem Components
Type	Description
Kafka Connect	Tool for integrating Kafka with external systems like databases, S3, etc.
Kafka Streams	Java library for building stream processing apps using Kafka topics.
ksqlDB	SQL-like interface to query Kafka topics and build real-time apps.
Schema Registry	Stores and enforces data formats (e.g., Avro, Protobuf).
Kafka REST Proxy	REST API interface to Kafka (for non-Java apps).

üåê 5. Kafka Message Format Types
Format Type	Use Case
JSON	Simple and widely supported.
Avro	Compact, fast, schema-based format (often used).
Protobuf	Efficient, binary format with schema support.
String	Plain text messages.
Byte Array	For custom or binary formats.
